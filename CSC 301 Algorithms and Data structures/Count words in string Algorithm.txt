1. Given a string of words, write a java method to count the # of
occurences of each word

"The cat jumps over the brown fox"
the x2
cat x1
...

Approach:
1. Seperate the words by spaces, put them into an array
2. Count each instance of word in the array when compared to itself

2 different methods
#1 mark first character after space, find space, cut out everything before
space, recursing until 
#2 Put stuff in the array

StringtoArray returns an array
Algorithm: StringtoArray(String, Int):
1. temp = index of " "


Diff Approach:
1. Iterate through string like an array
2. Place each word in a hashmap, key = word, value = # of occurences
3. If a word is repeated, value++;

Algorithm: CountWords(String):
1. WordMap = new HashMap<String, Integer>
2. temp[] = String.split(" ") //split the string into an array of Strings
3. for(String a : temp)
4.	if(WordMap.containsKey(a))
5.		WordMap.replace(a, value, value++)
6.	else
7.		WordMap.put(a, 1)
8. return WordMap
